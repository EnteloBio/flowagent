# Core Concepts

FlowAgent is built around several core concepts that work together to create powerful bioinformatics workflows.

## Agents

Agents are autonomous components that can perform specific tasks. Each agent has its own capabilities and can interact with other agents to complete complex workflows.

## Workflows

Workflows are sequences of tasks that are executed by agents. They can be linear or branching, and can include conditional logic and parallel execution.

## Tasks

Tasks are the individual units of work within a workflow. Each task has:

- Inputs
- Processing logic
- Outputs
- Error handling

## Events

Events are used to coordinate between agents and tasks. They can trigger actions, signal completion, or indicate errors.
